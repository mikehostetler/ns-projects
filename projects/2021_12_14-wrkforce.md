## Project summary

To enable more efficient, smooth, and rapid deployment of Network Steward funds by engaging the pkteer community to help guide the process through a weighted voting system.

### Registration process

A web platform will be developed wherein community members can register and vote.

- Account holders will be given the option to present personal identifying documents (KYC) to prove that they are not using fake accounts.
- Account holders will also be given the option to associate one or more PKT addresses with their account by making micro-transactions from those addresses.

### Funding rounds and submissions

During the activity of the fund, a funding round will be opened every 2 weeks. The budget of each round will be announced at opening time. The budget will be adapted based on the team's qualitative evaluation of proposals from the previous round - so as to avoid the risk of large rounds which bring only a few low quality applications.

During the active period of the fund, submission will be open at all times. Applicants who have submitted an application once and have not been accepted will be able to submit again in following rounds, with any changes they choose to make. Each applicant will be entitled to submit one application per round only, and applicants, as recipients of payment from Rungs LLC, will need to be KYCd before applying.

### Voting

Voting will be open to all registered participants, KYCd or not, at all times while the fund is active. Each registered user has a "number of votes" which are applied to the proposal when the user votes. The number of votes is defined as follows:

1. The user has the number of votes given by the current balance of their proven addresses divided by the sum of balance of all addresses proven by registered users on the platform.
2. If the person has done KYC then they have an additional: one, divided by the number of people who did KYC, votes.

### Winner selection

Winners will be selected in a way which seeks to maximize the "sum of satisfied votes" while being simple and understandable. The process will be for projects to be ranked by sum of votes divided by budget, then winners selected by iterating down the list until adding the next project would go over budget.

### Signing process

Winning projects will be presented a grant agreement to sign which will include a declaration of compliance with legal and ethical requirements. On top of each project, a 10% flat administrative fee will be added to the budget. This will cover labor, legal expenses, hosting, and additional unforseen expenses that may arise with the ongoing operation of the platform.

### Transparency and auditing

Every 90 days a 3rd party auditor will be hired by Wrkforce to come in under NDA to analyze votes and payment distributions to verify accuracy. This auditor will also attest to the community whether or not they believe the vote to be truthful.

This audit will be carried out by radicallyopensecurity.com on an on-going basis.

### GDPR Compliance & Data Security

The project will be built with the necessary functionality to comply with GDPR. Request for cookie acceptance will be available on all public web pages. Users will have the ability to submit a request for all of their data to be deleted from the system.

Additionally, the system will be constructed with all data being encrypted at rest in the database.

- [ ] Other deliverables (please describe)

The deliverables from the project to the Network Steward will be reports outlining the management level view of Wrkforce from the perspective of company which is managing the crypto assets for development of the software and on-going reports on what projects have been funded.

Each project/campaign/task delivers tangible outcomes relevant to the scope of the proposed initiative, and is paid incrementally based on the process developed for each initiative type. This will all be controlled by democratic vote by PKT community members which will register on the platfrom to participate.

Each deliverable report from the Company will include:

1. The balance of payments to Wrkforce.
1. The amount of money which was converted from PKT during the reported period.
1. For each event of selling PKT by the Company, the following information:
   1. Date
   1. Amount of PKT
   1. Strike price
   1. Purpose (administrative costs in development stage, development time, design, and build-out of work process templates primarily)
   1. Balance of PKT, USD, and other assets remaining at that time.
1. An overview of the financial status of the project, including a breakdown of costs (including administrative costs)
1. The composition of the team responsible for the development of the project, brief description of tasks and responsibilities and total hours worked.
1. Full disclosure on funded initiatives.
1. Attestation by a legal representative which confirms:
   1. That the above transaction and balance information is truly accurate
   1. That the company maintains honest integrity throughout the duration of the project
